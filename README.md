I did this in about 30 minutes and couldn't find a great screenshot of the old version. It looks fine but I only changed two colors. The main variables are in the contentScripts.js â€“ if you can send me a better screenshot or the actual colors (if any others are different) please do. Or even better, a Pull Request.

This also needs a logo so it can go on the Chrome Web Store. It's late here so I'll make one tomorrow.
